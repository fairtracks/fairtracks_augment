# The FAIRtracks augmentation service

The [FAIRtracks draft standard](https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_standard)
is a set of JSON Schemas that define a minimal standard for genomic track
metadata. The FAIRtracks augmentation service is a simple
Flask-based service written in Python that provides a HTTP-based API for
augmenting a minimal FAIRtracks JSON document with automatically generated
content for all the properties defined in the FAIRtracks JSON schemas with
`augmented=true.`

The FAIRtracks augmentation service fills out the following fields:
- The newest versions of all ontologies required by the FAIRtracks standard are
fetched and the versioned URLs are added to the `doc_info`->
`doc_ontology_versions` object.
- All `term_value` properties are generated by the related `term_id` property
by lookup in the relevant ontology.
- `track`->`file_name` is generated from the `track`->`file_url` property.a
- The two properties `sample`->`sample_type`->summary and
`experiment`->`target`->`summary` are generated based upon the relevant rule
as defined by `sample`->`biospecimen_class`->`term_id` and
`target`->`technique`->`term_id`, respectively, as described in the
top-level FAIRtracks schema.
- `sample`->`species_name` is generated by a lookup in the [NCBI Taxonomy
Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy)
